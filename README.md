# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator-APC-
Arbitrary-precision arithmetic, also called big number arithmetic, multiple precision
arithmetic, or sometimes infinite-precision arithmetic, indicates that calculations are
performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only by the available
memory of the host system. This contrasts with the faster fixed precision arithmetic
found in most arithmetic logic unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8
and 64 bits of precision. A common application is public-key cryptography, whose
algorithms commonly employ arithmetic with integers having hundreds of digits. The
goal of this project is to implement basic mathematical, modulus and power-of
operators of two large numbers.
Real Time Applications : 
1.Scientific Computing – Enables high-precision calculations required in physics, astronomy, and engineering simulations.
2.Mathematical Research and Number Theory – Used in studying prime numbers, factorials, and large number computations in pure mathematics.
